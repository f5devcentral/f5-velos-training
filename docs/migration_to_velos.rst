==================
Migration to VELOS
==================

F5 understands migrating configurations to new platforms can be a challenge and we’ve developed a tool that will help customers migrate existing BIG-IP configurations into VELOS tenants. F5 BIG-IP Journeys app assists with migrating a configuration from any supported BIG-IP version onto any supported VELOS version. Journeys allows:

•	Flagging source configuration feature parity gaps and fixing them with custom or F5 recommended solutions, automated deployment of the updated configuration to a TMOS based tenant running on VELOS and post-deployment validation.
•	List of possibly unsupported configuration features for the VELOS platform that the journeys app is able to catch.

The Journeys app is available for download at the F5 DevCentral Github site.
